Tracking a ball:    
  Step 1: Get measurements for each videoframe

    1) read videofile, get videoframes depending on rate variable. output all videoframes,  CODE: movtest.m
    2) histogram sliding using ref-image and fram frome video,  output: best histogram CODE: slowslide.m
    3) Use threshold_likely_pixels in order to set likely areas to ones and unlikely areas to zero.
    4) Use masscentre to get index of most likely pixel in order to set cross marker /sending measurement to tracking.
  
  Step 2: Track the ball
